            <h3>Albert Einstein: A Tribute</h3>
                    <label class="strong">Early Life</label>
                    <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. From a young age, 
                        he showed an extraordinary curiosity and a deep love for mathematics and physics.
                    </p>
                
                    <label class="strong">Education and Early Career</label>
                    <p>Einstein attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, where he graduated in 1900. 
                        Initially struggling to find an academic position, he worked at the Swiss Patent Office, 
                        which gave him ample time to develop his theories.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Theory of Relativity: </strong> 
                        Einstein is best known for his theory of relativity, 
                        which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation, ùê∏=ùëöùëê2,
                        demonstrated the relationship between mass and energy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Photo Electric Effect: </strong>
                        His work on the photoelectric effect, 
                        which explained how light can eject electrons from a material, earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Brownian Motion: </strong> Einstein provided a theoretical explanation for Brownian motion, 
                        offering strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules.
